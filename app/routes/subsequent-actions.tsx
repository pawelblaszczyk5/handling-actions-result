/* 

This is an example where I want to chain multiple actions while updating client state in meanwhile - hence I can't just chain them at action/serverAction level. Also in this hypothetical scenario they make sense as separate actions at the backend level, e.g. uploading file and then doing something with the uploaded file - it doesn't need to be "transaction" - it's fine if only file upload passes.

In that case similarly I can't use the trick with tracking previous data. And the `useEffect` chain is event more tedious and inconvenient. Obviously in this contrived example, the `currentAction` state could be derived in render function from fetchers `data` but it's not always possible, sometimes it's also firing callbacks or updating some global-ish state.

I removed error handling from this example for brevity so it'd be even more complicated in the reality. I think if we'd compare this with hypothetical world where `fetcher.submit` returns `Promise<some data>` it'd be sooo much easier ðŸ˜„
